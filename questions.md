Okay, here are the numerical analysis questions extracted from the notebook pages:

**N.A. (Numerical Analysis)**

**Q.1** - Solve by G.J Method (Gauss-Jordan Method):
```
x - y + 2z = 3
x + 2y + 3z = 5
3x - 4y - 5z = -13
```

**Q.2** - Explain Cholesky method steps with suitable example.
*(Note: The writing looks like "Stratus Cholesky", but "Cholesky" method is the standard term)*

**Q.3** - Find inverse of matrix A:
```
A = [ 1 -1  2 ]
    [ 4  0  6 ]
    [ 0  1 -1 ]
```

**Q.4** - Find inverse of matrix A by partition method:
```
A = [ 1  2  3  1 ]
    [ 1  3  3  2 ]
    [ 2  4  3  3 ]
    [ 1  1  1  1 ]
```

**Q.5** - Explain steps of finding Eigen values with suitable example.
